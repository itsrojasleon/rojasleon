          My name's Juan Luis Rojas Le√≥n. When I was 15 years old I discovered
          this incredible world of programming, after that I knew what my life
          purpose was going to be. I started programming with Java and PHP but
          it was a headache for me, then I switched to Javascript (I loved it, I
          wish I had started with than language... or another one like Python)
          and I'm still using it in my projects with Typescript. I have a little
          of experience with Python, c++ and swift but just the enough knowledge
          to "play" with them: small apps and data structures | algorithm
          problems.
