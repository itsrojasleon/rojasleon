# Playground

Write Javascript, Typescript or Markdown code and share it with anyone anywhere, similar to `play.golang.org`

This project is special to me because currently I'm learning Golang and decided to write the entire backend in `Go`. I realized that if you have some experience already using others languages is not hard at all to pick up other language.
